# Elm Electron guide
Get up and running with a cross-platform desktop app built in Elm.

Electron allows you to render web pages in Elm as native desktop interfaces. Electron runs a web page and manages native desktop interfaces (quit application, set global shortcut, create multiple windows, etc.) using NodeJS. See [jlord.us/essential-electron/](http://jlord.us/essential-electron/) for an excellent, readable conceptual overview of Electron.
